i'm take responsibility for my acivity;
photoshop and read smth it's not very efficient in this time;
i want to fun with animations!

const x1 = centerX - ball.x;
const y1 = centerY - ball.y;

const x2 = Math.cos(angle) * x1 - Math.sin(angle) * x1;
const y2 = Math.cos(angle) * x1 + Math.sin(angle) * y1;

ball.x = centerX + x2;
ball.y = centerY + y2;


take rotation for adjust cos and sin;

get position of ball, relative to line;

rotate coordinates 
( -> in which side need to move obj);

rotate velocity;

perform bounce with rotated values
